# Image Classification Using Pre-trained EfficientNetV2S Transfer Learning Model

## Overview
This project implements an image classification pipeline using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging a pre-trained EfficientNetV2S model. The script processes a dataset, trains the model, and predicts classes for test images. Key features include data augmentation, model fine-tuning, and exporting results as a CSV file.

---

## Usage
1. Ensure the dataset is organized into the required directory structure.
2. Replace `<path_to_your_dataset_directory>` in the script with the actual dataset path.
3. Locate the output CSV file to your desired path (`<path_to_your_output_directory>` + `/predictions.csv`).
4. Run the script to train the model and generate predictions.

## Implementation Details

### Dataset
- **Directory Structure**: The dataset should be organized into `train` and `test` directories.
- **Training Dataset**: Contains images organized into subdirectories by class.
- **Test Dataset**: Contains unlabeled images for which predictions are made.
- Replace `<path_to_your_dataset_directory>` with the actual dataset path.

### Dataset Preparation
- **Loading Training and Validation Data**:
  - The training dataset is split into training and validation subsets using `image_dataset_from_directory`.
  - Validation split: 1% of the training data.
- **Optimization**:
  - Datasets are cached, shuffled, and prefetched for performance improvements.

### Data Augmentation
- A `Sequential` layer applies data augmentation techniques:
  - Random horizontal flips.
  - Random rotations, zooms, and contrast adjustments.
- This enhances generalization by artificially expanding the training dataset.

### Model Architecture
- **Base Model**: EfficientNetV2S pre-trained on ImageNet.
  - Top layers are excluded (`include_top=False`).
  - The base model is frozen (`trainable=False`) to retain learned features.
- **Custom Head**:
  - A BatchNormalization layer normalizes inputs.
  - A GlobalAveragePooling2D layer reduces feature maps.
  - Fully connected layers (Dense) with a ReLU activation and Dropout for regularization.
  - The final Dense layer predicts 40 classes.

### Model Training
- **Loss Function**: Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy.
- **Optimizer**: Adam with a learning rate of 0.001.
- **Metrics**: Accuracy.
- The model is trained using `model.fit`, and performance metrics are stored in the `history` object.
- **Epochs**: The model is trained for 5 epochs for better results.

### Evaluation and Visualization
- Training and validation accuracy/loss are plotted for each epoch to monitor performance.

### Prediction and Submission
- Test images are preprocessed and passed to the trained model for predictions.
- Class probabilities are calculated using softmax.
- Results are saved as a CSV file with columns `image_id` and `class`.
